# Directory for streaming data project

People: Duncan, Simon Nadia

Goal: make a simple pipeline to learn how to code a simple streaming data pipeline

Approach: 
 1. Install ``streamz_ext`` from ``conda-forge`` channel of conda in a p3 env.
 1. try and run the ``live_plot.py`` example in the examples directory (this 
 was taken from the examples in the ``xpdAcq/streamz_ext`` GitHub repo)
 
 Log:
 1. working on a bug....``live_plot`` won't install ``node_style`` and we have no
 idea why....
