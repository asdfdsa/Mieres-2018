Datasets here produced using /diffstreamz/generate_data.py

The data comprizes two Gaussian functions  with Gaussian noise added to the data points. The two Gaussian functions move smoothly through a series of 100 'spectra' in 'peaks_moving_smoothly'.

These data can be loaded using np.loadtxt('peaks_moving_smoothly', delimiter=',')
